# Perkbox QA Challenge

Automation suite validating the multi account login feature

## Getting Started

This is a Maven project with JUnit as the test runner. I have used Cucumber framework for writing BDD scenarios.
 Also I have used IntelliJ as the IDE as it has built in support for writing Java Cucumber features. 

### Prerequisites

IntelliJ, Maven and Google Chrome (To run the tests)

### Installing

Open the project in IntelliJ or your desired IDE and run the following command to execute the tests.

```
mvn clean test
```

The tests can also be run through the IDE by running the RunCucumberTest.java class.

The task 1 and task 2 results are in the xls file
